## Using JavaScript in JupyterLab

> **TL;DR**
> This post will take you through installing JupyterLabs and how to add a NodeJS kernel to it in Ubuntu.

## Installing JupyterLabs

For a better experience, you should install Jupyter Lab inside a virtual environment. 

```shell
sudo  apt install python3-venv
```

After the installation is complete, create a new environment:

```
python3 -m venv jlab
```

> *Note that you can replace the `jlab` with any name of your choice.*

Now activate the environment:

```
. jlab/bin/activate
```

Now install Jupyter Lab in Ubuntu:

```
pip install jupyterlab
``` 

Once the installation is complete, you can start Jupyter lab by running:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

Jupyter Labs runs locally on port 8888: http://localhost:8888/

## Installing Javascript Kernel

Inside the activated virtual environment, install the javascript kernel by running:

```
npm install -g ijavascript
```

To activate the kernel, run:

```
ijsinstall
```

Re-start Jupyter lab:

```shell
jupyter lab
```
