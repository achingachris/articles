Learning never ends, especially for developers. That is why we have a lot of people who have sacrificed a lot to create great content for the developers' ecosystem.

In as much as most content can be gotten for free, we should be aware of vague content and/or resources that will make you think twice about your career.

I have made a list of 10 developer channels that I highly recommend if you'd love to learn and keep yourself updated. 

>Not that this list does not favor any channel or sponsored to appear here by any chance. These are purely educational and motivational content and not the "Daily Life of a Software engineer" kinda gigs.

# YouTube Channels

## 1. Traversy Media

The Channel is managed by [Traversy Media](https://twitter.com/traversymedia). Any content on web development is available and with demo source codes. I would recommend this channel to anyone, especially beginners.

Additional motivational content is published in the channel too, so don't worry about mental exhaustion.
