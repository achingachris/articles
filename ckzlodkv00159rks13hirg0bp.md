## Flutterwave WordPress Plugin

Flutterwave has a built-in WordPress plugin. 

On your WordPress Admin page, go to `plugins` and click on `add new`.

Search for `Flutterwave Payment Forms`

Other fields are optional, go ahead and save the settings.

## Using flutterwave shortcode

To be able to add the flutterwave payment forms, simply add the shortcodes into a WordPress page. The codes are as follows:

```shell
// button
 [flw-pay-button]

// button with text
[flw-pay-button]Button Text[/flw-pay-button]
```

On the editing page, select `shortcode` from the editing block:
