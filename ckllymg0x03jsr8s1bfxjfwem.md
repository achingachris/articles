# The Dev Tech Questions

The program was  [officially introduced](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevCMombasa/permalink/1256139174757396/)  in October 2020 by one of the greatest leads,  [Ingari A. Joan](https://www.facebook.com/groups/799116447126340/user/1105672396).

**I'll highlight a few posts I made for the Dev Tech Question below**:

## 1. HTTP response status codes

[Question](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevCMombasa/permalink/1279178819120098/) 

When developing websites on applications that connect to the internet, it is useful to know when a request made has been responded to by a server. HTTP Response codes help us know the status of the requests made on our applications.

I decided to write an  [article](https://theboringblog.netlify.app/blog/http-response-status-codes/)  listing the most common status codes that one should like at least have an idea of what they mean.

## 2. Array Cardio (JavaScript)

[Question](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevCMombasa/permalink/1260449354326378/)

This one a test on various methods and operations one can perform with a given array.

```js
const students = [ 
  { name: "Irene", yearStarted: 2015, yearCompleted: 2019 }, 
  { name: "Jamila", yearStarted: 2019, yearCompleted: 2020 }, 
  { name: "Swabra", yearStarted: 2018, yearCompleted: 2022 }, 
  { name: "Ali", yearStarted: 2000, yearCompleted: 2007 }, 
  { name: "Chris", yearStarted: 2001, yearCompleted: 2006 }, 
  { name: "Ken", yearStarted: 2020, yearCompleted: 2024 }, 
  { name: "Shantel", yearStarted: 2015, yearCompleted: 2021 }, 
  { name: "Martin", yearStarted: 2018, yearCompleted: 2020 }, 
  { name: "Salma", yearStarted: 2015, yearCompleted: 2019 },
];
```
The two questions asked were:

- Filter the array to get students who started in 2015 (use .fiter)
- Sort the Students alphabetically (use .sort)

Do you think you can solve the above question?
