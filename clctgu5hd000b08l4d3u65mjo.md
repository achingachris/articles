## GDG Nairobi

GDG Nairobi is a welcoming group of volunteer geeks that enthusiastically share their knowledge of Google technologies and work on new initiatives. The community organizes conferences, hackathons, and workshops to advance technological literacy and the development environment of the nation. Additionally, most of these events are free since the only barrier to education should be the will of people who wish to study it.
