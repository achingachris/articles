> *I have a message for some of you:* ***“Stop Just Hoarding Swag! How to Learn at Tech Conferences”.***

There’s no shortage of advice on how to deliver amazing talks or workshops at tech conferences, not to mention tips for preparing killer proposals and navigating the call for speakers.

But what about attendees? Sure, there are guides on becoming a good listener or an engaged participant, but this piece is different. This is about my experience and what makes a great attendee and listener.

# **Organizers & Speaker’s Sweat: A Behind-the-Scenes Look**

Before we dive into how to be a top-tier attendee, let’s take a moment to appreciate the efforts it takes to organize a tech event or deliver a talk.

## **Organizers**

These folks spend countless hours — sometimes days or weeks planning sessions and selecting speakers from an overwhelming pool of Call for Speakers submissions.

The proposals they review? Often incredible, making the job of picking the best even harder. Now, imagine this: many of these organizers are volunteers. ***Yes, volunteers!*** They do this out of sheer passion for building communities and creating meaningful experiences for attendees like you.

## **Speakers**

Submitting a proposal isn’t a walk in the park. It’s like applying for a highly competitive job. Speakers spend hours researching their topics, refining their proposals, and aligning their ideas with the event’s theme and audience.

Conferences like [PyCo](https://us.pycon.org/2025/)[n US, Dj](https://us.pycon.org/2025/)[an](https://2025.djangocon.africa/)[goCon Af](https://us.pycon.org/2025/)[rica, or DevFests aroun](https://2025.djangocon.africa/)[d the gl](https://developers.google.com/community/devfest)obe attract thousands of proposals. To even get accepted, speakers go through rounds of revisions, edits, and proofreads.

And the work doesn’t stop there. Once accepted, these rockstars have to [prepare](https://us.pycon.org/2025/) their pre[sentations *me*](https://2025.djangocon.africa/)[*ticulous*](https://developers.google.com/community/devfest)*ly* — fact-checking every detail, perfecting their delivery, and ensuring their content resonates with audiences of varying expertise. Don’t even get me started on live demos — those nail-biting showcases that can either dazzle or derail a session!

> *Recognizing this sweat equity makes it all the more important for attendees to show up as active, respectful, and engaged participants. After all, your experience as an attendee is a direct product of someone else’s hard work and dedication.*

# **So … Becoming a Great Attendee**

> *It should be an art ..*

## **You Spent Resources to Attend, So Make Them Count**

Tech conferences aren’t cheap. You probably forked out money for tickets, travel, and hotel stays, not to mention the emotional cost of pretending to like the event coffee. Don’t let all that go to waste!

Show up on time, attend sessions, and actively participate. ***Resist the urge to sneak out after grabbing the swag bag.*** Trust me, you didn’t travel halfway across the country just for another branded water bottle. Engage with the sessions, ask thoughtful questions, and *listen* (more on that next).

## **Listen and Give Constructive Feedback**

You came to learn, so act like it. Listening is an underrated superpower at tech events. Don’t be the person who spends the keynote scrolling through Twitter, only to raise their hand at the end with, *“Can you repeat the part about AI ethics?”*

Take notes, absorb the content, and if something doesn’t resonate, give constructive feedback. Organizers and speakers genuinely want to know what worked and what didn’t. **But let’s keep it classy, folks. “This session was awful” is not feedback; it’s trolling.** Instead, try: “The session was insightful, but I would’ve loved more live examples.”

## **Remember, You’re Not Alone**

Newsflash: Other people also paid to attend this event/or attended(if free). They’re here to learn, network, and maybe snag an extra croissant at breakfast. Respect their experience.

This means:

* Don’t hog the mic during Q&A. A question isn’t your time to pitch your startup.
    
* Be kind in networking spaces. Some folks are nervous, and your small talk could make their day.
    
* Share your insights without dominating the conversation. Nobody likes a one-person panel.
    

**You’re part of a community now. Act like it.**

## **Come Prepared: Gear Up for Technical Sessions**

If you know it’s a technical session, it’s probably a good idea to bring your laptop and get your hands dirty. What’s the point of attending a live coding workshop if all you’re doing is watching the presenter type at the speed of light?

Seriously, bring your gear. Install the software in advance if they’ve sent prep materials. Don’t be the person who spends the first 20 minutes of the session trying to configure your environment while everyone else is halfway through building a web app.

***Pro Tip: Keep some USB cables and a charger handy. Nothing says “rookie move” like running out of battery mid-session.***

## **Don’t RSVP for Free Events If You Won’t Be Attending**

Free events aren’t an all-you-can-eat buffet where you grab a plate and never sit down. If you RSVP and ghost, you’re not just messing with the organizers — you’re robbing someone else of the chance to attend. Imagine taking a seat from a budding developer who could’ve learned something life-changing, just because you *thought* you might show up. Be kind: RSVP responsibly. It’s not Tinder; don’t swipe right unless you’re serious!

# **Bonus Tips for Becoming an Attendee Rockstar**

* **Come Prepared:** Know the schedule, research the speakers, and jot down questions in advance. Nothing says “I belong here” like a well-thought-out question during a session.
    
* **Engage on Social Media:** Live-tweeting(or whatever we’re calling it on X these days)? Cool. Posting your notes on LinkedIn? Even better. Just make sure you’re not so glued to your phone that you miss the actual event.
    
* **Network Smartly:** Start with a compliment or a shared takeaway from a session. And please, for the love of tech gods, don’t shove your business card into people’s hands like it’s a limited-time coupon.
    
* **Respect Everyone’s Time:** Whether you’re talking to a speaker, organizer, or fellow attendee, be mindful. Nobody wants a 15-minute monologue about your side project at lunch.
    
* **Ask Questions Thoughtfully:** Don’t ask a question that was just answered five slides ago. Stay relevant and concise.
    

# **Final Thoughts**

Being a great attendee isn’t rocket science (unless you’re literally at a conference about rocket science). Show up, engage, and respect the effort that’s gone into creating the event. You’ll leave with more than swag — you’ll gain knowledge, connections, and maybe even a sense of community.

And remember: The better you are as an attendee, the more value you bring to the whole experience. Now go forth and be the attendee everyone wants at their next tech event!
