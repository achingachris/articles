TL;DR

I started focusing on projects that would land me my first ever software development job this week. So I have been dealing with creating applications with functionalities that introduce me to the most commonly used features throughout the industry.

So I have been working on payment integrations and re-designing my portfolio.

I love following the 'Build as I Learn' technique, so I started two projects, one called ' [Fundraiser](https://github.com/ChrisAchinga/fundraiser) ' and the other one ' [Community Space](https://github.com/ChrisAchinga/community-space) '.

##  [Fundraiser](https://github.com/ChrisAchinga/fundraiser) :

This is a donations application, I will be creating a campaign to help me get a MacBook (LOL). The front end is built using  [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)  and  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

For the payments, I will be using  [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), to make it easier for card payments.

## [Community Space](https://github.com/ChrisAchinga/community-space)

I spend most of my time in a  [community workspace](https://swahilipothub.co.ke/),  for the strong internet and of course the calm environment (It's just next to the ocean). So I am building this application that will enable community space booking, including the hall for corporate events. 

For the frontend, I am using  [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)  and  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I will add the booking/saving a spot feature and sending a confirmation receipt via email/phone number (I have never done that before, So help me Code - LOL)

## The Tech Stack

I am using React/Next for all the projects because I want to perfect the skills professionally and also build scalable applications that are up to  [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standards. 

I love challenging myself, so working with all projects that have to deal with payment integration will keep me up to pace with my timings and skills.

I also started working the "Professional Way". Yes, I use  [Trello](https://trello.com/)  to plan the project timeline and workflow. I feel like I worth more and need to use better tools for this.
