On September 10th, 2020,   [Facebook Developers announced the 2020 Developer Circles Community Challenge](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/09/10/welcome-our-2020-developer-circles-community-challenge/).

The challenge was on creating tutorials for using any of  [Facebook's open-source](https://opensource.facebook.com/)  products.

Submissions were really great and once again appreciating and stressing on the importance of developer communities.

I have gone through the regional and global submission winners and I'd love to highlight all React-based tutorials for beginners.
