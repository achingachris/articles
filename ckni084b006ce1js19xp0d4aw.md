>Hello world! I have been attending @[Hashnode](@hashnode) Bootcamp III and I have more confidence and reasons to keep blogging.


![5 reasons](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618437603915/9WlbdEf4r.png)

### TL;DR 

# I blog because ...

## 1. Community Motivation.

>because I'd love to give back to the community.

I had always wanted to write a blog ever since I started writing code, but it was hard for me to start initially. But since I prefer written tutorials to video ones, I came to learn of many great writers who share great content with the community for free.

What better reason to write technical blogs other than the love for the community 😍😍😍, I'd love to thank many writers for their content and motivation and constituency in their blogs, just to mention but a few: @[Edidiong Asikpo](@didicodes), @[Catalin's Tech](@Catalinpit), @[Ayushi Rawat](@ayushi7rawat), @[Marko Denic](@denic) and most importantly me @[Chris Achinga](@chrisdevcode).

## 2. Documenting My Journey

>because I'd love to remember how I got to where I am

A picture is worth a thousand words they say, I say a blog is worth a thousand memories and happiness. Once I hit a major stepping stone in my career, I have no better way than to write about it and share it with others, some may need that more than I do. 

For example, after deciding that I'll have React Native as one of my stacks, I wrote [What Is React Native, Building With React Native](https://chrisdev.hashnode.dev/what-is-react-native-building-with-react-native), and then [How I made my first website using an API 😎](https://chrisdev.hashnode.dev/how-i-made-my-first-website-using-an-api) because I was really struggling with APIs back then.

## 3. Explaining My Projects

>because I love explaining to people what I actually do

I am not the creativity-type of person, I kind of love improving what is in existence, so when I build anything that helps me in any way, I definitely have to document the moments 😁😁😁.

For example, since I use React frequently and the setting up process is always repetitive and boring 😩😩 at some point, I made me several starter templates, and wrote about one of them here: [Creating a React & Bootstrap Template](https://chrisdev.hashnode.dev/creating-a-react-and-bootstrap-template). 

This is me telling you I am a developer without telling you I am a developer!! (hope it makes sense 🤓🤓).

### 4. Teach.ing My Friends

>because to teach is to learn twice, also good to share knowledge

I enjoy sharing the little I know with my friends and peers. Because talking is cheap, how about I make some notes, write an article and publish it on @[Hashnode](@hashnode), that way, you can always refer to it anytime and or anywhere. I call it **Cloud Learning** 😎😎😎😎

I wrote [Git & GitHub: Installation and Configuration](https://chrisdev.hashnode.dev/git-and-github-installation-and-configuration) to help my best friend learn git and GitHub integration. @[Timothy Wangwe](@Wwangwe)

### 5. My Blog is My Resume

>because it shows other than tell

Marketing and branding oneself as a self-taught developer is one hell 😬😬 of a task here in my country where many people believe in academic papers, sad right 😭😭😭.

I believe showing a person what I do makes more impact than telling, and especially for the non-technical, who may or may not have heard of GitHub and how important it is to me/us, a blog might as well work for them.


#### Conclusion: 

I seriously don't have the 5 reasons only, they are a lot, and writing all of them would make this article longer and bore (it's not even technical right ... 😂😂😂). You can get me on Twitter or LinkedIn for a friendly professional chat.
