[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an API testing platform. You can use postman [web platform](https://web.postman.co/build):

![postman web](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622463645610/oxFQl2rDU.png)

 or the [desktop application](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing your APIs.

![desktopostman.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622463676467/hszDpAI4f.png)

Postman can be used to test all API requests: `get/put/create/delete`

If you are new to postman, I'd suggest you go through their Bootcamp: [https://web.postman.co/bootcamp](https://web.postman.co/bootcamp)

>I will be using the desktop application for the demos, they're no big differences from using the web version of postman.

# What this article covers:

1. Creating collections
2. Adding requests
3. Creating environments and Variables

## Creating Collections:

In Postman, collections are folders where you put all APIs with similar descriptions or projects together. It is a pretty neat way to organize your APIs for testing.

%[https://www.postman.com/collection/]

Follow the few steps to create an API collection:

1. Ensure that you are on the `collections` tab by clicking on the `Collections` with a folder icon on the top left side menu.

![Postman Collections](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622464771808/_Efr8gzTk.png)

On the right of the `Collections` notice the "+" icon and on hovering it, a pop up with the message:
"Create new Collection" appears.

![Create new collection - postman](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622464906540/ZxN90RsCe.png)

2. Click the "+" icon to create a new collection. Notice a new folder is created `New Collection` and a new tab opened simultaneously.

![created collection](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622465231380/AwDf6ycFG.png)

Right-click on the folder and select `rename` to give the collection a name of your choosing or double click on the `new collection` name on the tab to rename.

![double-click.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622465384147/nMOojo_40N.png)

![right-click.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622465402038/8fL-PSCHc.png)

PSST! I will rename mine to `Demo`

## Adding requests to a Collection:

On hovering over the collection name on the left panel. notice the 3-horizontal-dots, click on it to open a quick menu.

![Add a new request](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622466300790/DJHEL20g0.png)

Select `Add request` and notice a new tab opens:

![new-request.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622466869349/-5-l30skZ.png)

Let's add an API endpoint and make a request:

```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
```

Paste the URL in the input label with a placeholder text "Enter request URL", ensure the method on the left is set to "GET" and hit 'Send' to make a request.

The response:

## Creating environments and Variables

An environment in postman is just a collection of variables to be used in a request or a collection

%[https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/]

The selected environment status is at the top-right of Postman, the default is "*No environment*".

Here is how we create a new environment and add our variables:

On the left side of the postman web/app, click on the `Environment`.

Click on the "+" icon to create a new environment, then give it a name.

![new-env.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622802190419/iPKwrFEvI.png)

To create  a variable, manually fill the details on the environment tab:

I will create a variable for the base URL of the API endpoint:  `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`

```txt
VARIABLE: url
INITIAL VALUE: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
CURRENT VALUE: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
```

![variable](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622802642399/QTmA7D6M1.png)

To use the variable, go to the request tab and replace the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/` with   `{{url}}`

Then on the top-right, select an environment (select the one you just created from the Dropdown).

After that, make the request to see if everything went well:

There are many ways to create a variable, environment or collections in Postman, I just highlighted the common ones. Feel free to hover on the postman docs to learn and practice more:
