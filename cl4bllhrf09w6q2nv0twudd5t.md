## How to add Cloudinary to Strapi CMS for Image/Video uploads

[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is an open-source Headless CMS. 

> TL;DR:

The demo source code to this article can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/achingachris/cloudinary-on-strapi).

To get started, you need to have the following on your computer:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 +
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) Account

## Creating a Strapi Project

To create a new strapi project, run the following:

```shell
npx create-strapi-app@latest my-project --quickstart
```

After a successful installation, Strapi will automatically open a new browser for you to create a local account:

On the browser: http://localhost:1337/admin/auth/register-admin

## Installing Cloudinary Upload Plugin

To be able to integrate Cloudinary inside your Strapi project, you'll need to install the `provider-upload-cloudinary`:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@strapi/provider-upload-cloudinary

To install, run the following inside the root of your project:

```shell
npm install @strapi/provider-upload-cloudinary
```

Inside the `./config` folder, create a new file: `plugins.js` and paste the following:

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  upload: {
    config: {
      provider: "cloudinary",
      providerOptions: {
        cloud_name: env("CLOUDINARY_NAME"),
        api_key: env("CLOUDINARY_KEY"),
        api_secret: env("CLOUDINARY_SECRET"),
      },
      actionOptions: {
        upload: {},
        uploadStream: {},
        delete: {},
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Configuring environment variables

At the root of the project folder, locate the `.env` folder, and add the following:

```env
CLOUDINARY_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=
```
To find the credentials, log into your Cloudinary account and head over to the [account console/dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console).

You will find your API key and secret on the dashboard, and paste them to your `.env` file. Save and restart the development server:

```shell
npm run develop
```

On the admin dashboard, navigate to **Media Library** to test out the integration. Click on the `+ Add new assets` to upload image/images:

Upon a successful upload, the status code on your terminal will be 200, or if you check your Cloudinary dashboard, you'll see the image uploaded via Strapi.
