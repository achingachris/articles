>For the self-taught developer and (or) pretty much all developers, we use open source projects in our daily code, with or without knowing.

For real though, **Open Source (OS)** projects have made our work easier and surprisingly fun.

## TL;DR

# My First Open Source Contribution

It is always hard to find what open source projects you'd love to contribute to, especially when you are a beginner, well that's why we mostly end up fixing the typos and eventually, making impressive contributions with time.

It's about time I shared my first experience. (A very short story).

I had been a member of the Facebook Developer Circles Nairobi for some time when the  **[Open Source Immersion](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/open-source-immersion)** was announced. 

%[https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevCNairobi/permalink/3374954279235348/]

I googled on how to make contributions to the open-source, for the community. This was a simple case, what was needed was for community members to contribute to the  [Facebook Developers Circle Content repository](https://github.com/fbdevelopercircles/FbDevcCommunityContent) . It was a cool one.

A summary of what I did:

-  [Added a dev podcast link to the podcast list](https://github.com/fbdevelopercircles/FbDevcCommunityContent/commit/d0ba39522a1438619ac3dd19e7d6da4da162a666)

-  [Fix Merge conflicts](https://github.com/fbdevelopercircles/FbDevcCommunityContent/commit/1549ebfb32530616d5a122f65cac4eca40ec5654)  (LOL)

-  [Added blogs to the blogs list
](https://github.com/fbdevelopercircles/FbDevcCommunityContent/commit/ad15a80f3b6ba6819c6542ccd55683584bf7f5ae) 

## Lessons learned:

The main thing I gained was how to contribute to an already existing project using git and GitHub. Fixing a merge conflict was the best one.
